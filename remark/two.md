# the challenge

_usable_ computers are expensive.

**is it ?**

# !dea: a computer in a keyboard

1. connect to an HDMI monitor.

2. boot-up using a USB power-source.

3. start surfing.


* space/performance/power efficient.

---

# target Price

Rs. 5,000/-

---

# nope: not a thin-client

* a full-fledged stand-alone computer that allows users to:
  * surf the web
  * watch videos
  * chat
  * read/write/edit documents.
  * ...

one does not need the typical x86 to do all this - ARM boards provide sufficient compute at lower cost.

---

# others have tried it before...

* the only one in the market today is the Raspberry Pi 400

  + its' price point is closer to Rs. 9,000/-

in our humble opinion, it has more compute power than needed and provides too many choices for software. The out of box experience can be made more user friendly.

# hmmm, but how ?

* software

* packaging


* doing things simpler...

  1. hardware: utilizing boards meant for Android TVs.

  2. software: port/optimize chromium OS to work on these hardware.

  3. packaging: design a keyboard base and put the electronics there.

# yes, we can.

* ask me how ;-)
