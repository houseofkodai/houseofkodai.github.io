# startups: 4 stages

1. ideation:

   when smart/capable folks get together and argue - magic happens :-)

2. incubation:

   converting ideas into reality - building the science behind the magic.

3. traction:

   User eXperience: delivering the magic to the masses.

4. monitization:

   paying the bills - convincing users to share a tiny part of the value provided to them by us.

# interAd: don't be dumb.

  ## the idea: 
* interact with TV ads from your mobile within seconds.

---
# sounds good, but where are we today ?

## on-boarding and engaging users is our singular focus. 

* The technology is ready - ideation and incubation is complete.

* While we do have ideas about monitization; we believe it's premmature and a waste of resources to consider it at this stage.

# hmmm, ok... what's the target ?

* 1 million users in the 1st year.
  * We expect to spend about $5M to achieve this.
* 100 million users by the 3rd year.
  * We expect to spend about $50M to achieve this.

# sounds great - what's the traction plan for 1M users ?

* 1st city: Chennai
  * 11.5 million population
  * 50% of population is our target market.

* Our objective is to enhance consumer behavior

| Consumer Activity      | Frequency  |
|------------------------|------------|
| Foods, Grocery         |      Daily |
| Medicines, Movies      |     Weekly |
| Mobiles                |     Yearly |
| Automobiles            |    5 years |
| Houses                 |   25 years |
| Marriages              |   Lifetime |

# and...

* We will initially focus our resources on enhancing the consumer behavior - specifically daily/weekly activities.

* TV Channels in Chennai:
  * about 100 - 90% viewership channels owned/operated by about 4-5 groups.

* Brands:
  * Focus on daily/weekly use brands - since our focus is on user **engagement**

* There are about 25k registered street retailers in Chennai - they are the point of sale for the daily/weekly use brands.

# makes sense - what are the targets/timelines ?

* Q2: 200k users
* Q3: 300k users
* Q4: 500k users

# and the burn rates ?

marketing (2/3) and devops (1/3) in INR Cr.

|  Q  | Target | Marketing | Devops |
|-----|--------|-----------|--------|
|  Q1 |    0   |     1     |    2   |
|  Q2 |  200k  |     6     |    3   |
|  Q3 |  300k  |     8     |    4   |
|  Q4 |  500k  |    10     |    5   |

* We believe...
  * a plan for 100m users for years 2/3 at this time is pre-mature.
  * When we get to 1m users - the path would be revealed.
